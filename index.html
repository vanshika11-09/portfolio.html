        <p>"A special day to mark the year,</br>
            When you first appeared and drew near.</br>
            A time to gather and to cheer,</br>
            With loved ones who hold you dear.</br>
            
            From ancient gods to present-day,</br>
            Birthdays have been a common way,</br>
            To honor those who came to stay,</br>
            And brighten up life's every day.</br>
            
            With laughter, love, and joy to share,</br>
            We celebrate with cake and fanfare.</br>
            Another year, another layer,</br>
            Of memories made with those who care.</br>
            
            Of memories made with those who care.</br>
            So blow out the candles, make a wish,</br>
            A moment of hope and dreams to cherish.</br>
            For every year you've been and lived,</br>
            A life well-loved, a heart well-gifted."</p>
